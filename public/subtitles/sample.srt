Today I'm taking you on a beautiful walk through Central Park.

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,800
The weather is absolutely gorgeous, and I couldn't resist coming out here.

Look at these amazing fall colors! The leaves are just stunning.

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,000
I love how peaceful it is here, even in the middle of New York City.

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,300
There are so many people out enjoying the sunshine today.

00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,100
This is my favorite spot by the lake. I come here whenever I need to think.
